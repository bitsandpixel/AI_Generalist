  #### Define
  * The term "Vibe Coding" was coined by **Andrej Karparthy**.
  * **His Definition** -  There's a new kind of coding I call **"vibe coding"** where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMS(e.g. Cursor Composer W Sonnet) are getting too good. Also, I just talk to Composer with **SuperWishper** So I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like, "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages, I just copy paste them in with no comment, Usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I would have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug, so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throw-away weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or web app, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff and copy paste stuff. And it mostly works.
